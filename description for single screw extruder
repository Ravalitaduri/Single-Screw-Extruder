The project presents the Design and analysis of hot chamber to convert small pieces of plastics to molten state. The design of “SINGLE SCREW EXTRUDER” solves the problem of plastic waste management. This machine first converts the plastic waste into shredded plastic, and shredded plastic material goes in to the “EXTRUDER” then plastic melts with the help of heat then with the external force melt plastic goes to the core and converts into useful final product such as plastic sticks, bricks...etc. These products can be used in day-to-day life. In this project work ANSYS Fluent is used to determine the Pressure, Temperature, velocity and Heat flux profiles at various feed rates, Screw speeds, Helix angles and solidification at various zones.
